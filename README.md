# CodeArena

An app that allows you to video call random people then challenge them to a "coding battle" in an augmented reality arena.

Won't submit anything for the hackathon. I was busy all weekend. But will continue working on this project. Used the agora app builder, then created a quickstart app, then cloned the react demo app.
